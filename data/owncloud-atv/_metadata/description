A flexible, open source file sync and share solution
 ownCloud is a flexible, open source file sync and share solution. Whether using a mobile device, 
 a workstation, or a web client, ownCloud provides the ability to put the right files at your employees. 
 Fingertips on any device in one simple-to-use, secure, private and controlled solution.

 With the cydia packages below you can use ownCloud: 
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPad/iPhone
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 
 The package files will be stored at /var/www/owncloud
 During the installation the permission of some folders are set to the owner 'daemon:_www'. 

 Please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/owncloud'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome creates some problems.)
 
 During the installation you can choose MySQL or SQLite3.
 
 Using of SQLite3:
 - Quick, save and easy. Need not mutch memory.
 
 Using of MySQL:
 - You will get some errors one or two times. But that is not a problem. Reload the page and everything is fine.
 - You will needs an existing MySQL user and an existing MySQL database.
 - Before you start the ownCloud Setup, please create these with 'adminer' or the cydia packages 'phpmyadmin-atv'.
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/ownCloud will be deleted.
 If you use SQLite3, a database in /var/www/ownlcoud/ will be removed!
 If you use MySQL, the database will not be removed.
