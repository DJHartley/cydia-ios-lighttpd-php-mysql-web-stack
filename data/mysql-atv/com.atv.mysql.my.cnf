# This is an 'EXAMPLE" option/configuration file for MySQL
# It is for a system with little memory (32M - 64M) where MySQL plays
# an important part, or systems up to 128M where MySQL is used together with
# other programs (such as a web server)
#
# You will get more information here:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-configuration-defaults.html
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program
# with the "--help" option.

# The following options will be passed to all MySQL clients
[client]
#password		= your_password
port			= 3306
# Be careful with 'socket'. 
# Tools of MySQL-atv and PHP54/PHP53 needed the fix value '/tmp/mysql.sock'. 
# The best doing is do nothing with it.
