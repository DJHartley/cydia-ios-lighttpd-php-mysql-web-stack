A whole iPad/iPhone Web Server Solution Stack Composition
 A whole iPad/iPhone Web Server Solution Stack Composition.
 
 This software composition was originally compiled for the AppleTV but it works on all iOS devices.
 
 THIS LAUNCHER PACKAGES IS NOT FOR AppleTV DEVICES.
 IF YOU ARE ON AN AppleTV DEVICE PLEASE INSTALL THE CYDIA PACKAGE BELOW:
 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql'
  
 If you are not familiar in operation of console and shell scripting please don't install this package!
 
 This cydia package will install some sub cydia packages like:
 
 PHP54 v5.4.8
 Lighttpd-atv v1.4.31
 MySQL-atv v5.1.66
 
 The localtion of your web files is /var/www.
 If you need write permission to a www file or folder, change the owner to 'daemon:_www'
 The MySQL root user password is not set during the installation. Please change it as soon as possible.

 You will find the MySQL database files at /var/mysql
 
 With this cydia packages above you are now free to host your own Content Management Systems (CMS), Blogs, Bulletin Boards or File Servers.
 Such as ownCloud, WebsiteBaker, Contao, TYPO3, WordPress, Joomla!, phpBB, miniBB, etc.
 
 To save battery power and for safety reasons you can switch the servers on/off in your 'Device Settings'.
 To test the installation you have to start the servers and then run Safari on your iOS device and load the web site http://loaclhost.
 (I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome creates some problems with phpMyAdmin.)
 
 Additional 'example' config files below are installed:
 
 /etc/php.ini
 /etc/php.d/load_all.ini
 /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-atv.conf
 /etc/lighttpd/mod_fastcgi-atv.conf 
 
 An existing config files will be backed up.
 
 Furthermore a preference loader for a daemon launcher are installed.
 
 Please change your MySQL root password with the command below or with the also installed PHP script 'http://localhost/adminer.php':
 /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation
   
 If you would like to reinitialize your MySQL database please use this command:
 /usr/local/bin/mysql_install_db  --user=daemon
 
 
 The iOS preference launcher scripts are based on scripts from Wizardry and Steamworks:
