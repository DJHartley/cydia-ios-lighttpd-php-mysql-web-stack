A free, easy and secure, flexible and extensible management system (CMS)
 WebsiteBaker is free, easy and secure, flexible and extensible open source content management system (CMS).
 It helps you to create the website you want. Create new templates within minutes - powered by (X)HTML, CSS and jQuery.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use WebsiteBaker: 
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPad/iPhone
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 
 Please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/websitebaker'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome creates some problems.)
 
 The WebsiteBaker Setup needs an existing MySQL user and an existing MySQL database.
 Before you start the WebsiteBaker Setup, please create these with 'Adminer' or with the cydia packages 'phpmyadmin-atv'.
 
 After the WebsiteBaker Setup please log in your iDevice with a ssh shell and remove the folder
 /var/www/websitebaker/install
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/websitebaker will be deleted.
 Your MySQL database will not be removed.
