 Web installer for the newest Contao version.
 Contao is an open source content management system (CMS) for people who want a professional internet presence that is easy to maintain.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use Contao: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 After the package installation please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/contao/check'.
 
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
 The webinstaller will create files at /var/www/contao with permissions for the user 'daemon:_www'.
 
 After the Web-Installation you will find your Contao at 'http://your_ios_device/contao'
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/contao will be deleted.
 If you use MySQL, the database will not be removed.
