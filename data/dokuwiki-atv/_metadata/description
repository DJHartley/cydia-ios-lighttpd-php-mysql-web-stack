 DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text files . no database is required.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use DokuWiki: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 The package files will be stored at /var/www/dokuwiki
 During the installation the permission of some folders are set to the owner 'daemon:_www'. 
 
 Please restart your Lighttpd server after the installation! After that secure DokuWiki folders are hidden.
 
 Please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/dokuwiki/install.php'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
