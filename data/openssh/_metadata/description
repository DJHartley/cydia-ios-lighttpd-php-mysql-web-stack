secure remote access between machines
 OpenSSH (OpenBSD Secure Shell) is a set of computer programs providing encrypted communication sessions over a computer network using the SSH protocol.
 This version is newer than Saurik's version 6.0p1
 
 I also recommend the following package:
 'SSH Connect'
