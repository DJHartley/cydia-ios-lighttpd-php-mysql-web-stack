 phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the World Wide Web. 
 phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations with MySQL.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use phpMyAdmin: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 The package files will be stored at /var/www/phpmyadmin
 
 Please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/phpmyadmin'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
 
 Be careful with phpMyAdmin. Some hackers use it to get access to your system!
 If you do not use phpMyAdmin any more, please remove it as soon as possible.
