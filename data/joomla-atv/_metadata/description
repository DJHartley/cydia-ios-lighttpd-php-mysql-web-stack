Joomla! enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications. After the installation please open Safari and load the side 'http://your_ios_device/joomla'.
 Joomla! is an award-winning content management system (CMS), which enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use Joomla!: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 After the package installation please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/joomla'.
 
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
 The webinstaller will create files at /var/www/joomla with permissions for the user 'daemon:_www'.
  
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/joomla will be deleted.
