 The TYPO3 Introduction Package. Just to see how Typo3 does work.
 If you would like start with professional Typo3 development, I recommended to install the sources and the dummy packages from the Typo3 website.

 With the cydia packages below you can use Typo3: 
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad
 - 'touch-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPhone/iPad 
   (For safety reasons, you should not use the touch- package)
 
 The TYPO3 Setup needs an existing MySQL user and an existing MySQL database.
 Before you start the TYPO3 Setup, please create these with 'Adminer' or with the cydia package 'phpmyadmin-atv'. 
 
 Note: 
 After the installation you have to restart your Lighttpd-Server!
 
 Then open Safari and type in 'http://your_ios_device:8080'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome create some problems.)
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/typo3_introduction will be deleted.
 Your MySQL database will not be removed. 

 This package will install the additional package 'GraphicsMagick-atv'
