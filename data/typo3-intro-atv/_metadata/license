Licenses

The TYPO3 project, represented by the TYPO3 Association, uses different licenses

for the distribution of software and documentation
for contributions from individuals and corporations
We chose to distribute licenses as they support the vision and mission of the TYPO3 project:
"Inspiring People to Share" and "Jointly Innovate Excellent Free Software Enabling People to Communicate"

Our Contributor License Agreements are based on the Apache CLA and adapted to our needs. In our search for licenses we have found their model to be 
the fairest and most effective for both the contributors and the Association.

Generally, contributors retain full rights to use their original work, whilst giving the TYPO3 Association and its projects the right to distribute 
and build upon their work within the TYPO3 project.

Distribution Licenses
Software distributions are licensed as follows:

TYPO3 CMS 3.x - 4.x is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later
TYPO3 Neos CMS (under construction) is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 or later
TYPO3 Flow is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 or later
Contribution Licenses
Contributor License Agreements (CLA)
Starting with TYPO3 version 5, the TYPO3 Association requests all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to the TYPO3 projects (including 
TYPO3 Flow) to complete, sign, and submit an individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The same is recommended but not mandatory for 
contributions to TYPO3 CMS.

The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has been contributed to TYPO3. We need to have a 
signed CLA on file before we can grant you commit rights to any of the TYPO3 Neos projects.

A Corporate CLA (CCLA) is available for companies that contribute intellectual property that may have been assigned as part of an employment 
agreement. Please note: a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their individual CLA to cover any of their 
contributions which are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.
