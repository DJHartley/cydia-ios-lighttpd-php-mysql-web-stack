 We like to say that WordPress is both free and priceless at the same time.
 
 With the cydia packages below you can use WordPress: 
 - 'ios-lighttpd-php-mysql' for iPad/iPhone
 - 'atv-lighttpd-php-mysql' for AppleTV
 
 The package files will be stored at /var/www/wordpress
 During the installation the permission of the above folder will be set to owner 'daemon:_www'. 

 Please open Safari at your iOS Device and type in 'http://localhost/wordpress'.
 (Please use Safari. I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome creates some problems.)
 
 The WordPress Setup needs an existing MySQL user and an existing MySQL database.
 Before you start the WordPress Setup, please create these with 'Adminer' or with the cydia packages 'phpmyadmin-atv'.
 
 If you remove this package, please note that all content in /var/www/wordpress will be deleted.
 Your MySQL database will not be removed.
