 iOS WebStack is a proof of concept!
 If you are not familiar in web server administration: Please don't install this package!
 
 This iOS WebStack package includes PHP v5.3.28 with GD and MySQL support.
 
 This cydia package will install additional cydia sub packages like:
 - Lighttpd by Saurik (unmaintained, unsafe)
 - Lighttpd Daemon Launchers by Wizardry and Steamworks
 - MySQL by Wizardry and Steamworks
 - Graphic Libraries (jpeg/png/tiff) by Saurik (unmaintained, unsafe)
 
 To save battery power and for safety reasons you can switch the servers on/off in your 'Device Settings'.
 (If you would like restart the server, please wait 10 second between off and on switching.)
 
 To finish the installation you have to (re)start the servers and then run Safari on your iOS device and load the web site http://loaclhost and you will get all necessary information.
 (I don't know why, but e.g. Chrome creates some problems with phpMyAdmin.)
 
 The localtion of your web files is /var/www .
 If you need write permission to a www file or folder, change the owner to 'daemon:_www'
 The MySQL root user password is not set during the installation. Please change it as soon as possible.
 
 You will find the MySQL database at /var/lib/mysql
 
 With this cydia package you are now free to host your own Content Management Systems (CMS), Blogs, Bulletin Boards or File Servers.
 Such as ownCloud, WebsiteBaker, Contao, TYPO3, WordPress, Joomla!, phpBB, miniBB, etc.
