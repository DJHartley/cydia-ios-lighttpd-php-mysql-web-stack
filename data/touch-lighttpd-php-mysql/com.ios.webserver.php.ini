; PHP Example Configuration of Cydia packages iOS-WebStack


;Be careful with the socket path
mysql.default_socket     = /tmp/mysql.sock
pdo_mysql.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock
mysqli.default_socket    = /tmp/mysql.sock

;Limits
upload_max_filesize = 10M
post_max_size = 10M

;TimeZone
;You should simply replace "Europe/Berlin" with the desired timezone.
;The full list of supported time zones is available here: http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
date.timezone = "UTC"



;I recommends to place following lines to /etc/php.d/security.ini (it will not be touched
;from a cydia packages update).
;========================================================================================

;Please have a look at http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/php-security-best-practices-tutorial.html
;It is up to you to comment-out some directives.

;Make sure you log all php errors to a log file.
;Make sure that php and lighttpd have write permissions.
;log_errors=On
;error_log=/var/log/lighttpd/php_scripts_error.log

;To restrict PHP information leakage disable expose_php.
;Have a check befor and after: curl -I http://your.iOS-Web.server/yourPHPsite.php
 expose_php=Off

;Do not expose PHP error messages to all site visitors.
; display_errors=Off

;The allow_url_fopen option allows PHP's file functions - such as file_get_contents() and the
;include and require statements - can retrieve data from remote locations using ftp or http
;protocols. Programmers frequently forget this and don't do proper input filtering when passing
;user-provided data to these functions, opening them up to code injection vulnerabilities.
;A large number of code injection vulnerabilities reported in PHP-based web applications are
;caused by the combination of enabling allow_url_fopen and bad input filtering.
; allow_url_fopen=Off

;I also recommend to disable allow_url_include for security reasons:
; allow_url_include=Off

;If turned On, mysql_connect() and mysql_pconnect() ignore any arguments passed to them.
;Please note that you may have to make some changes to your code. Third party and open source
;application such as WordPress, and others may not work at all when sql.safe_mode enabled.
; sql.safe_mode=On

;It is also recommended that you turn off magic_quotes_gpc for all php 5.3.x installations
;as the filtering by it is ineffective and not very robust. mysql_escape_string() and
;custom filtering functions serve a better purpose (hat tip to Eric Hansen):
; magic_quotes_gpc=Off

;You can set maximum execution time of each php script, in seconds.
;Another recommend option is to set maximum amount of time each script
;may spend parsing request data, and maximum amount of memory a script may consume.
;GD picture converting needs a lot of memory. Be carefull with 'memory_limit'
;Set in seconds:
; max_execution_time =  30
; max_input_time = 30
; memory_limit = 40M
